| **[Exploring Expert Failures Improves LLM Agent Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13145v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13145v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents, excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions. Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g., GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance. Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT (53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and exceed 81 in SciWorld.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Meet Finance: Fine-Tuning Foundation Models for the Open FinLLM Leaderboard](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13125v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13125v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the application of large language models (LLMs) to financial tasks. We fine-tuned foundation models using the Open FinLLM Leaderboard as a benchmark. Building on Qwen2.5 and Deepseek-R1, we employed techniques including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their financial capabilities. The fine-tuned models demonstrated substantial performance gains across a wide range of financial tasks. Moreover, we measured the data scaling law in the financial domain. Our work demonstrates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in financial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Citation-Enhanced Generation for LLM-based Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16063v4)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.16063v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots. However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability. Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) approach combined with retrieval argumentation. Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way. It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module. Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations. Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs. Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks. Our codes and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Translating Real-World Code with LLMs: A Study of Translating to Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11514v3)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.11514v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise in code translation - the task of translating code written in one programming language to another language - due to their ability to write code in most programming languages. However, LLM's effectiveness on translating real-world code remains largely unstudied. In this work, we perform the first substantial study on LLM-based translation to Rust by assessing the ability of five state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT4, Claude 3, Claude 2.1, Gemini Pro, and Mixtral. We conduct our study on code extracted from real-world open source projects. To enable our study, we develop FLOURINE, an end-to-end code translation tool that uses differential fuzzing to check if a Rust translation is I/O equivalent to the original source program, eliminating the need for pre-existing test cases. As part of our investigation, we assess both the LLM's ability to produce an initially successful translation, as well as their capacity to fix a previously generated buggy one. If the original and the translated programs are not I/O equivalent, we apply a set of automated feedback strategies, including feedback to the LLM with counterexamples. Our results show that the most successful LLM can translate 47% of our benchmarks, and also provides insights into next steps for improvements.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012v2)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.09012v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>WIP, ...</summary><p>WIP, Homepage https://github.com/songrise/MLLM4Art</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v3)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.22512v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge Acquisition and Scaling Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09597v2)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.09597v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphAttack: Exploiting Representational Blindspots in LLM Safety Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13052v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13052v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been equipped with safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, but these guardrails can often be bypassed through "jailbreak" prompts. This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach to systematically generate jailbreak prompts through semantic transformations. We represent malicious prompts as nodes in a graph structure with edges denoting different transformations, leveraging Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) to parse user goals into semantic components that can be manipulated to evade safety filters. We demonstrate a particularly effective exploitation vector by instructing LLMs to generate code that realizes the intent described in these semantic graphs, achieving success rates of up to 87% against leading commercial LLMs. Our analysis reveals that contextual framing and abstraction are particularly effective at circumventing safety measures, highlighting critical gaps in current safety alignment techniques that focus primarily on surface-level patterns. These findings provide insights for developing more robust safeguards against structured semantic attacks. Our research contributes both a theoretical framework and practical methodology for systematically stress-testing LLM safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Among these is Arabizi, a hybrid form of Arabic that incorporates Latin characters and numbers to represent the spoken dialects of Arab communities. Arabizi is widely used on social media and allows people to communicate in an informal and dynamic way, but it poses significant challenges for machine translation due to its lack of formal structure and deeply embedded cultural nuances. This case study arises from a growing need to translate Arabizi for gisting purposes. It evaluates the capacity of different LLMs to decode and translate Arabizi, focusing on multiple Arabic dialects that have rarely been studied up until now. Using a combination of human evaluators and automatic metrics, this research project investigates the model's performance in translating Arabizi into both Modern Standard Arabic and English. Key questions explored include which dialects are translated most effectively and whether translations into English surpass those into Arabic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MT Summit 2025 (Track: Implementation and Case Studies) https://mtsummit2025.unige.ch/</p></details> |
| **[How Large Language Models Are Changing MOOC Essay Answers: A Comparison of Pre- and Post-LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13038v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13038v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs, but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13032v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.13032v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability) in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths (sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a 19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MemLLM: Finetuning LLMs to Use An Explicit Read-Write Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11672v3)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2404.11672v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current large language models (LLMs) perform well on many knowledge-related tasks, they are limited by relying on their parameters as an implicit storage mechanism. As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation.

| **[A Virtual Machine for Arbitrary Low-Precision GPGPU Computation in LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12984v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12984v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Accommodate Knowledge Conflicts in Retrieval-augmented LLMs: Towards Reliable Response Generation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12982v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12982v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG). Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation. Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs), with great customization flexibility, hold promises to enable individuals to create their own emotional support agents. In this work, we developed ChatLab, where users could construct LLM-powered chatbots with additional interaction features including voices and avatars. Using a Research through Design approach, we conducted a week-long field study followed by interviews and design activities (N = 22), which uncovered how participants created diverse chatbot personas for emotional reliance, confronting stressors, connecting to intellectual discourse, reflecting mirrored selves, etc. We found that participants actively enriched the personas they constructed, shaping the dynamics between themselves and the chatbot to foster open and honest conversations. They also suggested other customizable features, such as integrating online activities and adjustable memory settings. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for enhancing personalized emotional support through emerging AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[EmoVoice: LLM-based Emotional Text-To-Speech Model with Freestyle Text Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12867v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12867v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EmoVoice-DF55. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[DashChat: Interactive Authoring of Industrial Dashboard Design Prototypes through Conversation with LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12865v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12865v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial dashboards, commonly deployed by organizations such as enterprises and governments, are increasingly crucial in data communication and decision-making support across various domains. Designing an industrial dashboard prototype is particularly challenging due to its visual complexity, which can include data visualization, layout configuration, embellishments, and animations. Additionally, in real-world industrial settings, designers often encounter numerous constraints. For instance, when companies negotiate collaborations with clients and determine design plans, they typically need to demo design prototypes and iterate on them based on mock data quickly. Such a task is very common and crucial during the ideation stage, as it not only helps save developmental costs but also avoids data-related issues such as lengthy data handover periods. However, existing authoring tools of dashboards are mostly not tailored to such prototyping needs, and motivated by these gaps, we propose DashChat, an interactive system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate industrial dashboard design prototypes from natural language. We collaborated closely with designers from the industry and derived the requirements based on their practical experience. First, by analyzing 114 high-quality industrial dashboards, we summarized their common design patterns and inject the identified ones into LLMs as reference. Next, we built a multi-agent pipeline powered by LLMs to understand textual requirements from users and generate practical, aesthetic prototypes. Besides, functionally distinct, parallel-operating agents are created to enable efficient generation. Then, we developed a user-friendly interface that supports text-based interaction for generating and modifying prototypes. Two user studies demonstrated that our system is both effective and efficient in supporting design prototyping.</p></details> |  |

Towards long-context evaluation beyond retrieval and haystacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12845v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12845v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage, short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages, MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and training of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 Pa...</summary><p>33 Pages in Total - 23 (Main Manuscript) + 10 (Appendix)</p></details> |

For the critique generation part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex, socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might assume.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving (GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning, \textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train \textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems, GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs, achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS task.

While LLMs have shown promise in general web search scenarios, their effectiveness for evaluating domain-specific search results, such as educational resources, remains unexplored. To investigate different ways of including domain-specific criteria in LLM prompts for relevance judgement, we collected and released a dataset of 401 human relevance judgements from a user study involving teaching professionals performing search tasks related to lesson planning. We compared three approaches to structuring these prompts: a simple two-aspect evaluation baseline from prior work on using LLMs as relevance judges, a comprehensive 12-dimensional rubric derived from educational literature, and criteria directly informed by the study participants. Using domain-specific frameworks, LLMs achieved strong agreement with human judgements (Cohen's $\kappa$ up to 0.650), significantly outperforming the baseline approach. The participant-derived framework proved particularly robust, with GPT-3.5 achieving $\kappa$ scores of 0.639 and 0.613 for 10-dimension and 5-dimension versions respectively. System-level evaluation showed that LLM judgements reliably identified top-performing retrieval approaches (RBO scores 0.71-0.76) while maintaining reasonable discrimination between systems (RBO 0.52-0.56). These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively evaluate educational resources when prompted with domain-specific criteria, though performance varies with framework complexity and input structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in the LLM4Eval Workshop Co-located with WSDM '25 in Hannover, Germany</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures, design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields. By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Why and How LLMs Hallucinate: Connecting the Dots with Subsequence Associations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12691v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12691v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a performance gap between open-source and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%, surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves model performance but also improves training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02193</p></details> |

We present WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage, configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite higher performance on question-answering tasks. To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data. On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output row by 3x.</p></details> |  |

Retraining entire models from scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical. Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope, and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain. Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale pre-trained language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

While HCI research focuses on domain-specific applications, little is known about how heavy users integrate LLMs into everyday decision-making. Through qualitative interviews with heavy LLM users (n=7) who employ these systems for both intuitive and analytical thinking tasks, our findings show that participants use LLMs for social validation, self-regulation, and interpersonal guidance, seeking to build self-confidence and optimize cognitive resources. These users viewed LLMs either as rational, consistent entities or average human decision-makers. Our findings suggest that heavy LLM users develop nuanced interaction patterns beyond simple delegation, highlighting the need to reconsider how we study LLM integration in decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

One significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character, statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3, rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1 increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1 improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.</p></details> |  |

This exploratory study evaluates position bias in LLM judges across pairwise and list-wise comparison settings, introducing three metrics: repetition stability, position consistency, and preference fairness. Our experiments, involving 15 LLM judges across MTBench and DevBench with 22 tasks and approximately 40 solution-generating models, result in over 150,000 evaluation instances. We identify Judge-Level, Candidate-Level, and Task-Level factors contributing to bias. The findings confirm that position bias is not due to random chance and varies significantly across judges and tasks. While position bias is weakly influenced by the length of prompt components, it is strongly affected by the quality gap between solutions. Our agreement and disagreement analysis among judges further provides insights into the distribution of judging difficulty across the dataset, and highlights the potential for dataset modifications.</p></details> |  |

In practice, such tools often produce high false positive rates, particularly in large codebases like the Linux kernel. This imprecision can arise from simplified vulnerability modeling and over-approximation of path and data constraints. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding, their naive application to program analysis yields unreliable results due to inherent reasoning limitations. We introduce BugLens, a post-refinement framework that significantly improves static analysis precision. BugLens guides an LLM to follow traditional analysis steps by assessing buggy code patterns for security impact and validating the constraints associated with static warnings. Evaluated on real-world Linux kernel bugs, BugLens raises precision from 0.10 (raw) and 0.50 (semi-automated refinement) to 0.72, substantially reducing false positives and revealing four previously unreported vulnerabilities. Our results suggest that a structured LLM-based workflow can meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of static analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

These games are designed to evaluate a range of capabilities such as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, safety, and adaptability.

However, how to estimate their accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution, revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset, for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error margin as small as 3.37%.</p></details> |  |

These simulacra serve as sandboxes for studying human behaviour without compromising privacy or safety. However, it remains unclear whether such agents can truly represent real individuals. This work compares survey data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) on healthcare decision-making with simulated responses from generative agents. Using demographic-based prompt engineering, we create digital twins of survey respondents and analyse how well different LLMs reproduce real-world behaviours. Our findings show that some LLMs fail to reflect realistic decision-making, such as predicting universal vaccine acceptance. However, Llama 3 captures variations across race and Income more accurately but also introduces biases not present in the UAS data. This study highlights the potential of generative agents for behavioural research while underscoring the risks of bias from both LLMs and prompting strategies.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker), knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity.

Previous work on LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments, graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and 2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain question answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments generated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.

It addresses the gaps in existing LLM evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks: (i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench, HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms. By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness (mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/MCILAB/LLM_Alignment_Evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Despite the urgency, few prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER, achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores. Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and (2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT) baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook.

While previous works focused on either evaluating over stateless web services (RESTful API), based on a single turn user prompt, or an off-policy dialog trajectory, ToolSandbox includes stateful tool execution, implicit state dependencies between tools, a built-in user simulator supporting on-policy conversational evaluation and a dynamic evaluation strategy for intermediate and final milestones over an arbitrary trajectory. We show that open source and proprietary models have a significant performance gap, and complex tasks like State Dependency, Canonicalization and Insufficient Information defined in ToolSandbox are challenging even the most capable SOTA LLMs, providing brand-new insights into tool-use LLM capabilities.

But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and large language models (LLMs) across four real-world scenarios: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings reveal concerning misalignments between humans and LLMs, such as humans frequently endorse values like "National Security" which were largely rejected by LLMs. We also observe that values differ across scenarios, highlighting the need for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides valuable insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, laying the foundations for developing AI systems that responsibly reflect societal values and ethics.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we formulate the task of selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs, differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining a complete and accurate causal graph poses a formidable challenge, recognized as an NP- hard problem. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, indicating their emergent capabilities and widespread applicability in facilitating causal reasoning across diverse domains, such as medicine, finance, and science. The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the potential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering interpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel causal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize data-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of a more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of three integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and LLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a dynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible causal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two demonstrations on seven well-known datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ALCM outperforms existing LLM methods and conventional data-driven causal reasoning mechanisms. This study not only shows the effectiveness of the ALCM but also underscores new research directions in leveraging the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While AI tools like large language models (LLMs) have the potential for personalized learning planning, they face issues such as transparency and hallucinated information. To address this, we propose PlanGlow, an LLM-based system that generates personalized, well-structured study plans with clear explanations and controllability through user-centered interactions. Through mixed methods, we surveyed 28 participants and interviewed 10 before development, followed by a within-subject experiment with 24 participants to evaluate PlanGlow's performance, usability, controllability, and explainability against two baseline systems: a GPT-4o-based system and Khan Academy's Khanmigo. Results demonstrate that PlanGlow significantly improves usability, explainability, and controllability. Additionally, two educational experts assessed and confirmed the quality of the generated study plans. These findings highlight PlanGlow's potential to enhance personalized learning and address key challenges in self-directed learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>WIP, ...</summary><p>WIP, Homepage https://github.com/songrise/MLLM4Art</p></details> |

However, enhancing policy exploration to more effectively scale test-time compute remains underexplored in VLMs. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective RL approach that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images to introduce targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns. Without additional training cost, NoisyRollout enhances the exploration capabilities of VLMs by incorporating a vision-oriented inductive bias. Furthermore, NoisyRollout employs a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, ensuring benefit from noisy signals early while maintaining training stability and scalability in later stages. With just 2.1K training samples, NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models on 5 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning both reasoning and perception tasks, while preserving comparable or even better in-domain performance.</p></details> | Technical Report |

In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks.

Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning Without Verbalized Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12951v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12951v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs. By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So, are retrials all you need?</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 16 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.06691</p></details> |

However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the intricate nature of logical reasoning poses challenges when gathering reliable data from the web to build comprehensive training datasets, subsequently affecting performance on downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel logic-driven data augmentation approach, AMR-LDA. AMR-LDA converts the original text into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, a structured semantic representation that encapsulates the logical structure of the sentence, upon which operations are performed to generate logically modified AMR graphs. The modified AMR graphs are subsequently converted back into text to create augmented data. Notably, our methodology is architecture-agnostic and enhances both generative large language models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, through prompt augmentation, and discriminative large language models through contrastive learning with logic-driven data augmentation. Empirical evidence underscores the efficacy of our proposed method with improvement in performance across seven downstream tasks, such as reading comprehension requiring logical reasoning, textual entailment, and natural language inference. Furthermore, our method leads on the ReClor leaderboard at https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/503/leaderboard/1347.

Inspired by DeepLogic, an end-to-end model trained to perform inference on logic programs, we introduce IMA-GloVe-GA, an iterative neural inference network for multi-step reasoning expressed in natural language. In our model, reasoning is performed using an iterative memory neural network based on RNN with a gated attention mechanism. We evaluate IMA-GloVe-GA on three datasets: PARARULES, CONCEPTRULES V1 and CONCEPTRULES V2. Experimental results show DeepLogic with gated attention can achieve higher test accuracy than DeepLogic and other RNN baseline models. Our model achieves better out-of-distribution generalisation than RoBERTa-Large when the rules have been shuffled. Furthermore, to address the issue of unbalanced distribution of reasoning depths in the current multi-step reasoning datasets, we develop PARARULE-Plus, a large dataset with more examples that require deeper reasoning steps. Experimental results show that the addition of PARARULE-Plus can increase the model's performance on examples requiring deeper reasoning depths.

Towards long-context evaluation beyond retrieval and haystacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12845v1)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12845v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage, short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages, MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and training of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 Pa...</summary><p>33 Pages in Total - 23 (Main Manuscript) + 10 (Appendix)</p></details> |

We propose Emotion Interpretation (EI), focusing on causal factors-whether explicit (e.g., observable objects, interpersonal interactions) or implicit (e.g., cultural context, off-screen events)-that drive emotional responses. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To facilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring multifaceted emotions. Each instance demands rationale-based explanations rather than straightforward categorization. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Self-Ask (CFSA) annotation pipeline, which guides Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) through iterative question-answer rounds to yield high-quality labels at scale. Extensive evaluations on open-source and proprietary large language models under four experimental settings reveal consistent performance gaps-especially for more intricate scenarios-underscoring EI's potential to enrich empathetic, context-aware AI applications.

Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |

However, whether these MLLMs possess human-like compositional reasoning abilities remains an open problem. To unveil their reasoning behaviors, we first curate a \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}ssumptive \textbf{R}ea\textbf{s}oning Benchmark (MARS-Bench) in this paper. Interestingly, we find that most prevalent MLLMs can be easily fooled by the introduction of a presupposition into the question, whereas such presuppositions appear naive to human reasoning. Besides, we also propose a simple yet effective method, Active Deduction (AD), a novel reinforcement learning paradigm to encourage the model to actively perform composite deduction before reaching a final decision. Equipped with the proposed AD method, a MLLM demonstrates significant improvements in assumptive reasoning abilities without compromising its general-purpose question-answering performance. We also provide extensive evaluations of both open-source and private MLLMs on MARS-Bench, along with experimental analyses of the AD method.</p></details> |  |

Through causal probing experiments in controlled arithmetic reasoning tasks, we found systematic internal reasoning patterns across models in our case study; for example, single-step subproblems are solved before CoT begins, and more complicated multi-step calculations are performed during CoT.</p></details> |  |

Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel reward system considering think-answer logical consistency, the model achieves slow-thinking capabilities with limited computational resources. After training on only 5k embodied video samples, Embodied-R with a 3B LM matches state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning models (OpenAI-o1, Gemini-2.5-pro) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution embodied spatial reasoning tasks.

Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and (2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT) baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we investigate the applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in existing perception datasets annotated by humans.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often produce coarse, imprecise, and non-interpretable localization. A major challenge lies in the quality and scale of existing geolocation datasets. These datasets are typically small-scale and automatically constructed, leading to noisy data and inconsistent task difficulty, with images that either reveal answers too easily or lack sufficient clues for reliable inference. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive geolocation framework with three key components: GeoComp, a large-scale dataset; GeoCoT, a novel reasoning method; and GeoEval, an evaluation metric, collectively designed to address critical challenges and drive advancements in geolocation research. At the core of this framework is GeoComp (Geolocation Competition Dataset), a large-scale dataset collected from a geolocation game platform involving 740K users over two years. It comprises 25 million entries of metadata and 3 million geo-tagged locations spanning much of the globe, with each location annotated thousands to tens of thousands of times by human users. The dataset offers diverse difficulty levels for detailed analysis and highlights key gaps in current models. Building on this dataset, we propose Geographical Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT), a novel multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision Models (LVMs) in geolocation tasks. GeoCoT improves performance by integrating contextual and spatial cues through a multi-step process that mimics human geolocation reasoning. Finally, using the GeoEval metric, we demonstrate that GeoCoT significantly boosts geolocation accuracy by up to 25% while enhancing interpretability.</p></details> | Update new version |

However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis), a method to self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various LLMs and design choices.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%.

We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems.

We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions.

These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, project page at https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/</p></details> |

Our approach leverages chain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are subsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The pipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a two-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated reinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable decision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated startup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by 54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a standalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision of a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with explicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional decision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and continuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the implementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes investment environments and other domains that require transparent and data-driven insights.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final hidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We argue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth, struggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a nuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{ReaRec}, the first inference-time computing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user representations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec autoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential recommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to decouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space. Moreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods, Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to further effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments on five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec. Remarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the performance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by approximately 30\%-50\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and promising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks. We have open-sourced the source code, model checkpoint and datasets at https://github.com/NetManAIOps/ChatTS.</p></details> | accepted by VLDB' 25 |

Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.</p></details> | Preprint |

Interestingly, we have observed that using certain other languages in reasoning tasks can yield better performance than English. However, this phenomenon remains under-explored. In this paper, we explore the upper bound of harnessing multilingualism in reasoning tasks, suggesting that multilingual reasoning promises significantly (by nearly 10 Acc@$k$ points) and robustly (tolerance for variations in translation quality and language choice) higher upper bounds than English-only reasoning. Besides analyzing the reason behind the upper bound and challenges in reaching it, we also find that common answer selection methods cannot achieve this upper bound, due to their limitations and biases. These insights could pave the way for future research aimed at fully harnessing the potential of multilingual reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |

However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

They often rely on limited ontologies, lacking structured reasoning capabilities and comprehensive coverage. This raises an important research question: Will medical knowledge improve predictive models to support stepwise clinical reasoning as performed by human doctors? To address this problem, we propose DuaLK, a dual-expertise framework that combines two complementary sources of information. For external knowledge, we construct a Diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG) that encodes both hierarchical and semantic relations enriched by large language models (LLM). To align with patient data, we further introduce a lab-informed proxy task that guides the model to follow a clinically consistent, stepwise reasoning process based on lab test signals. Experimental results on two public EHR datasets demonstrate that DuaLK consistently outperforms existing baselines across four clinical prediction tasks. These findings highlight the potential of combining structured medical knowledge with individual-level clinical signals to achieve more accurate and interpretable diagnostic predictions.

To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge.

Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning.

Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades-off between bias and variance.</p></details> |  |

The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term "graph linearization", so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality and degeneracy. These methods are further enhanced using node relabeling techniques. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to the random linearization baseline. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multimodal processing using a unified transformer model.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.</p></details> |  |

Trained with a large-scale reinforcement learning pipeline from Qwen2.5-72B, Kimina-Prover demonstrates strong performance in Lean 4 proof generation by employing a structured reasoning pattern we term \textit{formal reasoning pattern}. This approach allows the model to emulate human problem-solving strategies in Lean, iteratively generating and refining proof steps. Kimina-Prover sets a new state-of-the-art on the miniF2F benchmark, reaching 80.7% with pass@8192. Beyond improved benchmark performance, our work yields several key insights: (1) Kimina-Prover exhibits high sample efficiency, delivering strong results even with minimal sampling (pass@1) and scaling effectively with computational budget, stemming from its unique reasoning pattern and RL training; (2) we demonstrate clear performance scaling with model size, a trend previously unobserved for neural theorem provers in formal mathematics; (3) the learned reasoning style, distinct from traditional search algorithms, shows potential to bridge the gap between formal verification and informal mathematical intuition. We open source distilled versions with 1.5B and 7B parameters of Kimina-Prover</p></details> | 22 pages |

Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first ever-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable testbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, 10 pages for main text</p></details> |

To enable broader applications, some works have attempted to transfer these capabilities to multimodal reasoning. However, these efforts have been limited by the limited difficulty of selected tasks and relatively small training scales, making it challenging to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMK12 dataset and MM-EUREKA with 7B and 32B parameters. The former is a high-quality multimodal mathematics reasoning dataset featuring diverse knowledge domains with human-verified answers and solution processes. The latter is a multimodal model employing rule-based reinforcement learning on MMK12, utilizing online filtering and two-stage training strategy to enhance training stability. MM-EUREKA demonstrates remarkable performance gains in multimodal mathematical reasoning, outperforming previous powerful models like InternVL2.5-78B or InternVL2.5-38B-MPO. In particular, MM-EUREKA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models, and trails slightly behind o1 in multidisciplinary reasoning tasks. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA</p></details> |  |

Supervised fine-tuning on such reasoning traces, also known as distillation, can be a cost-effective way to boost reasoning capabilities of student models. However, empirical observations reveal that these reasoning trajectories are often suboptimal, switching excessively between different lines of thought, resulting in under-thinking, over-thinking, and even degenerate responses. We introduce Retro-Search, an MCTS-inspired search algorithm, for distilling higher quality reasoning paths from large reasoning models. Retro-Search retrospectively revises reasoning paths to discover better, yet shorter traces, which can then lead to student models with enhanced reasoning capabilities with shorter, thus faster inference. Our approach can enable two use cases: self-improvement, where models are fine-tuned on their own Retro-Search-ed thought traces, and weak-to-strong improvement, where a weaker model revises stronger model's thought traces via Retro-Search. For self-improving, R1-distill-7B, fine-tuned on its own Retro-Search-ed traces, reduces the average reasoning length by 31.2% while improving performance by 7.7% across seven math benchmarks. For weak-to-strong improvement, we retrospectively revise R1-671B's traces from the OpenThoughts dataset using R1-distill-32B as the Retro-Search-er, a model 20x smaller. Qwen2.5-32B, fine-tuned on this refined data, achieves performance comparable to R1-distill-32B, yielding an 11.3% reduction in reasoning length and a 2.4% performance improvement compared to fine-tuning on the original OpenThoughts data. Our work counters recently emergent viewpoints that question the relevance of search algorithms in the era of large reasoning models, by demonstrating that there are still opportunities for algorithmic advancements, even for frontier models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data will be publicly released upon internal approval</p></details> |

However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge from natural language remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active experience with the physical world. Given this scenario, semantic knowledge graphs can serve as conceptual spaces that guide the automated text generation reasoning process to achieve more efficient and explainable results. In this paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the explicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and applies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical connections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three metaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they require deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this integrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in understanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning processes, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding, especially for domain-specific metaphors. Furthermore, we propose a thorough error analysis, discussing issues with metaphorical annotations and current evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in specialized domains like ophthalmology remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluated and compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed reasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice ophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting. Quantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed against ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a subset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified ophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning structure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and DeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in Macro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>83 pa...</summary><p>83 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, 9 supplementary figures, 7 supplementary tables</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce VisualPuzzles, a benchmark that targets visual reasoning while deliberately minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge. VisualPuzzles consists of diverse questions spanning five categories: algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. One major source of our questions is manually translated logical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. Experiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive domain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks like MMMU, enabling us to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks. Additionally, reasoning enhancements such as scaling up inference compute (with "thinking" modes) yield inconsistent gains across models and task types, and we observe no clear correlation between model size and performance. We also found that models exhibit different reasoning and answering patterns on VisualPuzzles compared to benchmarks with heavier emphasis on knowledge. VisualPuzzles offers a clearer lens through which to evaluate reasoning capabilities beyond factual recall and domain knowledge.</p></details> | 56 pages, 43 figures |

Inspired by recent research on external feedback mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), we propose a multimodal actor-critic framework to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities. Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning paths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these reasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively refines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is deemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual annotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal critique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we systematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To obtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an annotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared ancestor node - one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an incorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based Multimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive training and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments conducted on several public benchmark datasets and mainstream VLMs demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of VLM on complex multimodal reasoning tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and wide applicability.</p></details> |  |

We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to "think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks - Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~ 5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context. By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by 2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data released at: https://github.com/letta-ai/sleep-time-compute</p></details> |

These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have begun to explore the characteristics of real-world large-scale microservice deployments; however, their operational complexities, and the degree to which this complexities are consistent across different deployments, remains under-explored. In this paper, we analyse a microservice dataset released by Alibaba along three dimensions of complexity: scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. We find that large-scale deployments can consist of tens of thousands of microservices, that support an even broader array of front-end functionality. Moreover, our analysis shows wide-spread long-tailed distributions of characteristics between microservices, such as share of workload and dependencies, highlighting inequality across the deployment. This diversity is also reflected in call graphs, where we find that whilst front-end services produce dominant call graphs, rarer non-dominant call graphs are prevalent and could involve dissimilar microservice calls. We also find that runtime dependencies between microservices deviate from the static view of system dependencies, and that the deployment undergoes daily changes to microservices. We discuss the implications of our findings for state-of-the-art research in microservice management and research testbed realism, and compare our results to previous descriptions of large-scale microservice deployments to begin to build an understanding of their commonalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 24 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain. This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |

While its improvement has enhanced the ability to reveal data patterns by sample groups, these MDS-based methods require prior assumptions for inference, limiting their application in general microbiome analysis. In this study, we introduce a new MDS-based ordination, $F$-informed MDS, which configures the data distribution based on the $F$-statistic, the ratio of dispersion between groups sharing common and different characteristics. Using simulated compositional datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to hyperparameter selection while maintaining statistical significance throughout the ordination process. Various quality metrics for evaluating dimensionality reduction confirm that $F$-informed MDS is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in preserving both local and global data structures. Its application to a diatom-associated bacterial community suggests the role of this new method in interpreting the community response to the host. Our approach offers a well-founded refinement of MDS that aligns with statistical test results, which can be beneficial for broader compositional data analyses in microbiology and ecology. This new visualization tool can be incorporated into standard microbiome data analyses.</p></details> |  |

VBTSs have emerged as a promising solution, offering high spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness by sensing contact through camera-captured deformation patterns of elastic gel pads. However, these sensors' complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing requirements present unique challenges for robotic applications. The lack of efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTS has significantly limited the scale and scope of tactile robotics research. Here we present Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics research and development. By enabling large-scale simulation and experimentation with tactile sensing, Taccel accelerates the development of more capable robotic systems, potentially transforming how robots interact with and understand their physical environment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Large-Scale Contextual Market Equilibrium Computation through Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15459v2)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.15459v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, recieved at IJTCS2025 conference</p></details> |

Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://colmon46.github.io/i2e-bench-leaderboard/ .</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Multi-scale Cross-axis Attention (MCA) to solve the above challenging issues based on the efficient axial attention. Instead of simply connecting axial attention along the horizontal and vertical directions sequentially, we propose to calculate dual cross attentions between two parallel axial attentions to capture global information better. To process the significant variations of lesion regions or organs in individual sizes and shapes, we also use multiple convolutions of strip-shape kernels with different kernel sizes in each axial attention path to improve the efficiency of the proposed MCA in encoding spatial information. We build the proposed MCA upon the MSCAN backbone, yielding our network, termed MCANet. Our MCANet with only 4M+ parameters performs even better than most previous works with heavy backbones (e.g., Swin Transformer) on four challenging tasks, including skin lesion segmentation, nuclei segmentation, abdominal multi-organ segmentation, and polyp segmentation.

| **[C2GM: Cascading conditional generative cartography framework for multi-scale tile map generation with geographic feature constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04991v2)** | 2025-04-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04991v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.</p></details> |  |

There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications. We release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.</p></details> |  |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Optimizing Utility-Scale Solar Siting for Local Economic Benefits and Regional Decarbonization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12508v1)** | 2025-04-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12508v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to $34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by 2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by 39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5% in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1 billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to AMIA 2025 annual symposium (https://amia.org/education-events/amia-2025-annual-symposium)</p></details> |

However, current methods often produce coarse, imprecise, and non-interpretable localization. A major challenge lies in the quality and scale of existing geolocation datasets. These datasets are typically small-scale and automatically constructed, leading to noisy data and inconsistent task difficulty, with images that either reveal answers too easily or lack sufficient clues for reliable inference. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive geolocation framework with three key components: GeoComp, a large-scale dataset; GeoCoT, a novel reasoning method; and GeoEval, an evaluation metric, collectively designed to address critical challenges and drive advancements in geolocation research. At the core of this framework is GeoComp (Geolocation Competition Dataset), a large-scale dataset collected from a geolocation game platform involving 740K users over two years. It comprises 25 million entries of metadata and 3 million geo-tagged locations spanning much of the globe, with each location annotated thousands to tens of thousands of times by human users. The dataset offers diverse difficulty levels for detailed analysis and highlights key gaps in current models. Building on this dataset, we propose Geographical Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT), a novel multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision Models (LVMs) in geolocation tasks. GeoCoT improves performance by integrating contextual and spatial cues through a multi-step process that mimics human geolocation reasoning. Finally, using the GeoEval metric, we demonstrate that GeoCoT significantly boosts geolocation accuracy by up to 25% while enhancing interpretability.</p></details> | Update new version |

Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.</p></details> |  |

However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer a flexible and data-efficient foundation for statistical emulation, but their poor scalability limits applicability to large datasets. We introduce the Scaled Block Vecchia (SBV) algorithm for distributed GPU-based systems. SBV integrates the Scaled Vecchia approach for anisotropic input scaling with the Block Vecchia (BV) method to reduce computational and memory complexity while leveraging GPU acceleration techniques for efficient linear algebra operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed implementation of any Vecchia-based GP variant. Our implementation employs MPI for inter-node parallelism and the MAGMA library for GPU-accelerated batched matrix computations. We demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic and real-world workloads, including a 50M point simulation from a respiratory disease model. SBV achieves near-linear scalability on up to 64 A100 and GH200 GPUs, handles 320M points, and reduces energy use relative to exact GP solvers, establishing SBV as a scalable and energy-efficient framework for emulating large-scale scientific models on GPU-based distributed systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

This limits opportunities for students to practice how to clarify ambiguous requirements -- a critical skill in real-world programming. In addition, the emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to produce code from well-defined specifications may harm student engagement with traditional programming exercises. This study explores the use of ``Probeable Problems'', automatically gradable tasks that have deliberately vague or incomplete specifications. Such problems require students to submit test inputs, or `probes', to clarify requirements before implementation. Through analysis of over 40,000 probes in an introductory course, we identify patterns linking probing behaviors to task success. Systematic strategies, such as thoroughly exploring expected behavior before coding, resulted in fewer incorrect code submissions and correlated with course success. Feedback from nearly 1,000 participants highlighted the challenges and real-world relevance of these tasks, as well as benefits to critical thinking and metacognitive skills. Probeable Problems are easy to set up and deploy at scale, and help students recognize and resolve uncertainties in programming problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ITiCSE 2025</p></details> |

Extensive research in making T2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society. To help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for users features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these models. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to prevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities can easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing concern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities. Moreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes both prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples. This work proposes a million-scale prompt and image dataset generated using open-source diffusion models. Second, we develop a multimodal defense to distinguish safe and NSFW text and images, which is robust against adversarial attacks and directly alleviates current challenges. Our extensive experiments show that our model performs well against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy and recall, drastically reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal adversarial attack scenarios.

The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author copy of an article accepted for publication by ACM.

While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Previous model-based methods, such as Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), require the strong assumptions of a shared covariance matrix between all classes. Quadratic discriminant analysis will often lead to singular or unstable covariance matrix estimates. Both of these methods can lead to lower-than-desired classification performance. We introduce a novel, model-based clustering method that can relax the shared covariance assumptions of LDA by clustering sample covariance matrices, either singular or non-singular. In addition, we study the statistical properties of parameter estimates. This will lead to covariance matrix estimates which are pooled within each cluster of classes. We show, using simulated and real data, that our classification method tends to yield better discrimination compared to other methods.</p></details> |  |

The model introduces an enhanced C2f structure, a dynamic feature recombination module, and a novel loss function that incorporates auxiliary bounding boxes and angular constraints. These innovations improve multi-scale feature fusion and small object localization while significantly reducing computational overhead. Evaluated on a public wood defect dataset, CFIS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 77.5\%, outperforming the baseline YOLOv10s by 4 percentage points. On SOPHON BM1684X edge devices, CFIS-YOLO delivers 135 FPS, reduces power consumption to 17.3\% of the original implementation, and incurs only a 0.5 percentage point drop in mAP. These results demonstrate that CFIS-YOLO is a practical and effective solution for real-world wood defect detection in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures |

Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first ever-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable testbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, 10 pages for main text</p></details> |

We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA.

However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.</p></details> |  |

Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by experienced human evaluators.

However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>WIP, ...</summary><p>WIP, Homepage https://github.com/songrise/MLLM4Art</p></details> |

We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation.

However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions.

Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, most research has focused on RL methods that use sentence-level feedback, leading to inefficient learning signals due to the reward sparsity problem -- the model receives a single score for the entire sentence. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages fine-grained, token-level quality assessments along with error severity levels using RL methods. Specifically, we use xCOMET, a state-of-the-art quality estimation system, as our token-level reward model. We conduct experiments on small and large translation datasets with standard encoder-decoder and large language models-based machine translation systems, comparing the impact of sentence-level versus fine-grained reward signals on translation quality. Our results show that training with token-level rewards improves translation quality across language pairs over baselines according to both automatic and human evaluation. Furthermore, token-level reward optimization improves training stability, evidenced by a steady increase in mean rewards over training epochs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, work-in-progress</p></details> |

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59).

To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

During training, we use the PRM to estimate uncertainty after the forward pass, retaining only highly uncertain data. A capable yet costly reasoning model then labels this data. Then we compute the loss with respect to the labels and update the PRM's weights. We compare ActPRM vs. vanilla fine-tuning, on a pool-based active learning setting, demonstrating that ActPRM reduces 50% annotation, but achieving the comparable or even better performance. Beyond annotation efficiency, we further advance the actively trained PRM by filtering over 1M+ math reasoning trajectories with ActPRM, retaining 60% of the data. A subsequent training on this selected dataset yields a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) PRM on ProcessBench (75.0%) and PRMBench (65.5%) compared with same sized models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Among existing methods, Process Reward Models (PRMs) stand out for offering dense, step-wise supervision to guide intermediate reasoning. However, how to effectively integrate PRMs into search strategies remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce PRM-BAS (PRM-Guided Beam Annealing Search), a lightweight approach for PRM-guided reasoning that dynamically adjusts beam size -- starting with a broader search space and gradually narrowing it as contextual information accumulates, thereby balancing performance and efficiency. We further propose a unified framework for data construction and PRM training. Specifically, we construct the PRM-BAS-300k dataset by selecting 300k questions from existing datasets and performing rollouts at each step to estimate the probability of reaching a correct final answer. The PRM is then trained using a combination of value loss for absolute action quality and rank loss for relative action quality. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PRM-BAS significantly improves reasoning performance while maintaining low computational cost. Moreover, it generalizes well across different model scales and architectures, showcasing strong robustness and plug-and-play capability.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues. Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications. Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference. Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation. Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list. Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available.</p></details> |  |

Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we identify a model preference bias in RMs, where they systematically assign disproportionately high scores to responses from certain policy models. This bias distorts ranking evaluations and leads to unfair judgments. To address this issue, we propose a calibration method named CHatbot Arena calibrated Reward Modeling (CHARM) that leverages Elo scores from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard to mitigate RM overvaluation. We also introduce a Mismatch Degree metric to measure this preference bias. Our approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a small preference dataset for continued training of the RM. We conduct extensive experiments on reward model benchmarks and human preference alignment. Results demonstrate that our calibrated RMs (1) achieve improved evaluation accuracy on RM-Bench and the Chat-Hard domain of RewardBench, and (2) exhibit a stronger correlation with human preferences by producing scores more closely aligned with Elo rankings. By mitigating model preference bias, our method provides a generalizable and efficient solution for building fairer and more reliable reward models.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting preferences for the adaptation process in robotics is often challenging and time-consuming. In this work we explore the adaptation of pre-trained robots in the low-preference-data regime. We show that, in this regime, recent adaptation approaches suffer from catastrophic reward forgetting (CRF), where the updated reward model overfits to the new preferences, leading the agent to become unable to perform the original task. To mitigate CRF, we propose to enhance the original reward model with a small number of parameters (low-rank matrices) responsible for modeling the preference adaptation.

In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.</p></details> | work in progress |

We propose a novel iterative self-training approach for self-training reranker models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), aimed at improving both reranking accuracy and the overall code generation process. Unlike traditional PPO approaches, where the focus is on optimizing a generative model with a reward model, our approach emphasizes the development of a robust reward/reranking model. This model improves the quality of generated code through reranking and addresses problems and errors that the reward model might overlook during PPO alignment with the reranker. Our method iteratively refines the training dataset by re-evaluating outputs, identifying high-scoring negative examples, and incorporating them into the training loop, that boosting model performance. Our evaluation on the MultiPL-E dataset demonstrates that our 13.4B parameter model outperforms a 33B model in code generation quality while being three times faster. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 and surpasses it in one programming language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECIR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

Without external auxiliary, Genius requires to seek the optimal response sequence in a stepwise manner and optimize the LLM. To explore the potential steps and exploit the optimal ones, Genius introduces a stepwise foresight re-sampling strategy to sample and estimate the step value by simulating future outcomes. Further, we recognize that the unsupervised setting inevitably induces the intrinsic noise and uncertainty. To provide a robust optimization, we propose an advantage-calibrated optimization (ACO) loss function to mitigate estimation inconsistencies.

Predicting the next word in an existing text has turned out to be a powerful signal, at least at scale. But there are signs that we are running out of this resource. In recent months, interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus, both for "alignment" (with a reward model judging the quality of instruction following attempts) and for improving "reasoning" (process- and outcome-based verifiers judging reasoning steps). In this paper, we explore to what extent synthetic interaction in what we call Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can provide a learning signal, and how this signal can be used. We introduce an environment for producing such interaction data (with the help of a Large Language Model as counterpart to the learner model), both offline and online. We investigate the effects of supervised fine-tuning on this data, as well as reinforcement learning setups such as DPO, and GRPO; showing that all of these approaches achieve some improvements in in-domain games, but only GRPO demonstrates the ability to generalise to out-of-domain games as well as retain competitive performance in reference-based tasks.

In the global exploration phase, P&R generates a diverse set of plans for the given input, where each plan consists of a list of diverse query aspects with corresponding additional descriptions. This phase is followed by a local exploitation phase that generates a response proposal for the input query conditioned on each plan and iteratively refines the proposal for improving the proposal quality. Finally, a reward model is employed to select the proposal with the highest factuality and coverage. We conduct our experiments based on the ICAT evaluation methodology--a recent approach for answer factuality and comprehensiveness evaluation. Experiments on the two diverse information seeking benchmarks adopted from non-factoid question answering and TREC search result diversification tasks demonstrate that P&R significantly outperforms baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% improvement on the ANTIQUE dataset and a 15.41% improvement on the TREC dataset. Furthermore, a smaller scale user study confirms the substantial efficacy of the P&R framework.</p></details> |  |

Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.</p></details> | Under Submission |

However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D2-DPO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D2-DPO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D2-DPO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D2-DPO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</p></details> |  |

However, significant challenges exist when transitioning reward signal to the multimodal domain, including labor-intensive annotations, over-reliance on one-step rewards, and inadequate evaluation. To address these issues, we propose SVIP, a novel approach to train a step-level multi-dimensional Chain-of-Thought~(CoT) reward model automatically. It generates code for solving visual tasks and transforms the analysis of code blocks into the evaluation of CoT step as training samples. Then, we train SVIP-Reward model using a multi-head attention mechanism called TriAtt-CoT. The advantages of SVIP-Reward are evident throughout the entire process of MLLM. We also introduce a benchmark for CoT reward model training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that SVIP-Reward improves MLLM performance across training and inference-time scaling, yielding better results on benchmarks while reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning ability.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity.

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |

However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?} To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods. Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities.

However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that directly model the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.</p></details> | Ongoing work |

However, reward engineering can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Instead, human-in-the-loop RL methods hold the promise of learning reward functions from human feedback. Despite recent successes, many of the human-in-the-loop RL methods still require numerous human interactions to learn successful reward functions. To improve the feedback efficiency of human-in-the-loop RL methods (i.e., require less human interaction), this paper introduces Sub-optimal Data Pre-training, SDP, an approach that leverages reward-free, sub-optimal data to improve scalar- and preference-based RL algorithms. In SDP, we start by pseudo-labeling all low-quality data with the minimum environment reward. Through this process, we obtain reward labels to pre-train our reward model without requiring human labeling or preferences. This pre-training phase provides the reward model a head start in learning, enabling it to recognize that low-quality transitions should be assigned low rewards. Through extensive experiments with both simulated and human teachers, we find that SDP can at least meet, but often significantly improve, state of the art human-in-the-loop RL performance across a variety of simulated robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench \citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Toward a theoretical understanding of how to best leverage additional computation, we focus on inference-time alignment, which we formalize as the problem of improving the quality of responses drawn from a pre-trained policy, given a prompt of interest and access to an imperfect reward model. We analyze the performance of inference-time alignment algorithms in terms of (i) response quality, and (ii) compute, and provide new results that highlight the importance of the pre-trained policy's coverage over high-quality responses for performance and compute scaling: 1. We show that Best-of-$N$ alignment with an ideal choice for $N$ can achieve optimal performance under stringent notions of coverage, but provably suffers from reward hacking when $N$ is large, and fails to achieve tight guarantees under more realistic coverage conditions. 2. We introduce $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$, a new algorithm which mitigates reward hacking through deliberate use of inference-time compute, implementing the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via rejection sampling; we prove that its performance is optimal and does not degrade with $N$, meaning it is scaling-monotonic. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental evaluation that demonstrate the benefits of $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$ across a variety of tasks and models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions.

While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's coverability of the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose novel transfer learning principles and a theoretical algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Empirically, inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a win-rate-based transfer policy selection method with improved computational efficiency. Moreover, our empirical transfer learning technique is modular and can be integrated with various policy optimization methods, such as DPO, IPO and XPO, to further enhance their performance.

First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.</p></details> | 11oages,2 figures |

State of the art (SOTA) code repair methods rely on data-driven approaches and often fail to deliver solution for complicated programming questions. To interpret the natural language of unprecedented programming problems, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-feedback generation is crucial. LLMs generate more comprehensible feedback than compiler-generated error messages, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) further enhances quality by integrating human-in-the-loop which helps novice students to lean programming from scratch interactively. We are applying RLHF fine-tuning technique for an expected Socratic response such as a question with hint to solve the programming issue. We are proposing code feedback generation tool by fine-tuning LLM with RLHF, Automated Code Evaluation with RLHF (ACE-RLHF), combining two open-source LLM models with two different SOTA optimization techniques. The quality of feedback is evaluated on two benchmark datasets containing basic and competition-level programming questions where the later is proposed by us. We achieved 2-5% higher accuracy than RL-free SOTA techniques using Llama-3-7B-Proximal-policy optimization in automated evaluation and similar or slightly higher accuracy compared to reward model-free RL with AI Feedback (RLAIF).

While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT/GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the normalized reward of a batch as the baseline. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods.

To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems.

To obtain high-quality process supervision labels and rationale data, we propose Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and a rationale synthesis framework that incorporates code verification. Experimental results on ProcessBench and several mathematical reasoning tasks show that GenPRM significantly outperforms prior PRMs with only 23K training data from MATH dataset. Through test-time scaling, a 1.5B GenPRM outperforms GPT-4o, and a 7B GenPRM surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench. Additionally, GenPRM demonstrates strong abilities to serve as a critic model for policy model refinement.

However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges.

Prior work highlights a potential self-preference bias where LLMs favor their own generated responses, a tendency often intensifying with model size and capability. This raises a critical question: Is self-preference detrimental, or does it simply reflect objectively superior outputs from more capable models? Disentangling these has been challenging due to the usage of subjective tasks in previous studies. To address this, we investigate self-preference using verifiable benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, factual knowledge, code generation) that allow objective ground-truth assessment. This enables us to distinguish harmful self-preference (favoring objectively worse responses) from legitimate self-preference (favoring genuinely superior ones). We conduct large-scale experiments under controlled evaluation conditions across diverse model families (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Mistral, Phi, GPT, DeepSeek). Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Better generators are better judges -- LLM evaluators' accuracy strongly correlates with their task performance, and much of the self-preference in capable models is legitimate. (2) Harmful self-preference persists, particularly when evaluator models perform poorly as generators on specific task instances. Stronger models exhibit more pronounced harmful bias when they err, though such incorrect generations are less frequent. (3) Inference-time scaling strategies, such as generating a long Chain-of-Thought before evaluation, effectively reduce the harmful self-preference. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of LLM-based evaluation and practical insights for improving its reliability.</p></details> | Preprint. 31 pages |

We introduce Structural Alignment, a novel method that aligns LLMs with human-like discourse structures to enhance long-form text generation. By integrating linguistically grounded discourse frameworks into reinforcement learning, our approach guides models to produce coherent and well-organized outputs. We employ a dense reward scheme within a Proximal Policy Optimization framework, assigning fine-grained, token-level rewards based on the discourse distinctiveness relative to human writing. Two complementary reward models are evaluated: the first improves readability by scoring surface-level textual features to provide explicit structuring, while the second reinforces deeper coherence and rhetorical sophistication by analyzing global discourse patterns through hierarchical discourse motifs, outperforming both standard and RLHF-enhanced models in tasks such as essay generation and long-document summarization.

To address these limitations, we propose RMB, a comprehensive RM benchmark that covers over 49 real-world scenarios and includes both pairwise and Best-of-N (BoN) evaluations to better reflect the effectiveness of RMs in guiding alignment optimization. We demonstrate a positive correlation between our benchmark and the downstream alignment task performance. Based on our benchmark, we conduct extensive analysis on the state-of-the-art RMs, revealing their generalization defects that were not discovered by previous benchmarks, and highlighting the potential of generative RMs. Furthermore, we delve into open questions in reward models, specifically examining the effectiveness of majority voting for the evaluation of reward models and analyzing the impact factors of generative RMs, including the influence of evaluation criteria and instructing methods.

To bridge this gap, we propose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated learning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time code execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an automated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time code execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools based on outcome feedback. ReTool employs a systematic training framework, beginning with synthetic cold-start data generation to produce code-augmented long-form reasoning traces for fine-tuning base models. Subsequent RL training leverages task outcomes as rewards to iteratively refine the model's tool use strategy, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal tool invocation patterns without human priors. Experiments on the challenging MATH Olympiad benchmark AIME demonstrate ReTool's superiority: Our 32B model achieves 67% accuracy with 400 training steps, outperforming text-based RL baseline (40% accuracy, 1080 steps) in efficiency and performance. Remarkably, ReTool-32B attains 72.5% accuracy in extended settings, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%. Further analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as code self-correction, signaling an ''aha moment'' in which the model autonomously masters adaptive tool use. These findings highlight the promise of outcome-driven tool integration for advancing complex mathematical reasoning and offer new insights into hybrid neuro-symbolic systems.</p></details> | fix typos |

However, enhancing policy exploration to more effectively scale test-time compute remains underexplored in VLMs. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective RL approach that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images to introduce targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns. Without additional training cost, NoisyRollout enhances the exploration capabilities of VLMs by incorporating a vision-oriented inductive bias. Furthermore, NoisyRollout employs a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, ensuring benefit from noisy signals early while maintaining training stability and scalability in later stages. With just 2.1K training samples, NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models on 5 out-of-domain benchmarks spanning both reasoning and perception tasks, while preserving comparable or even better in-domain performance.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, such materials, particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on the generation of new topological materials through a generative model. Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the largest known in this category.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks.

Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

However, their performance heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear, high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead, making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.</p></details> |  |

The learning objective is to achieve desired positions from random initial conditions while adhering to both transient and steady-state performance specifications. This objective is challenging for conventional one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning, due to the strong coupling between position and orientation dynamics, the complexity in designing and tuning the reward function, and poor sample efficiency, which necessitates substantial computational resources and leads to extended convergence times. To address these challenges, this work decomposes the learning objective into a three-stage curriculum that incrementally increases task complexity. The curriculum begins with learning to achieve stable hovering from a fixed initial condition, followed by progressively introducing randomization in initial positions, orientations and velocities. A novel additive reward function is proposed, to incorporate transient and steady-state performance specifications. The results demonstrate that the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based curriculum learning approach, coupled with the proposed reward structure, achieves superior performance compared to a single-stage PPO-trained policy with the same reward function, while significantly reducing computational resource requirements and convergence time. The curriculum-trained policy's performance and robustness are thoroughly validated under random initial conditions and in the presence of disturbances.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Optimizing AoI in multicast networks is challenging due to the coupling of multicast routing and scheduling decisions, the complexity of the multicast, and the graph representation. This paper focuses on dynamic multicast networks and aims to minimize the expected average AoI by integrating multicast routing and scheduling. To address the inherent complexity of the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subtasks amenable to hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We propose the first RL framework to address the multicast routing problem, also known as the Steiner Tree problem, by incorporating graph embedding and the successive addition of nodes and links. For graph embedding, we propose the Normalized Graph Attention mechanism (NGAT) framework with a proven contraction mapping property, enabling effective graph information capture and superior generalization within the hierarchical RL framework. We validate our framework through experiments on four datasets, including the real-world AS-733 dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can be $11.56\times$ more computationally efficient than traditional multicast routing algorithms while achieving approximation ratios of 1.1-1.3, comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Additionally, our age-optimal TGMS algorithm reduces the average weighted Age of Information (AoI) by 25.6% and the weighted peak age by 29.2% in low-energy scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.</p></details> |  |

Instead, our approach uses cross attention signals within the model itself to derive a self supervised reward, thereby guiding iterative fine tuning of the model policy. By analyzing how the model attends to the input prompt during generation, we construct measures of prompt coverage, focus, and coherence. We then use these measures to rank or score candidate responses, providing a reward signal that encourages the model to produce well aligned, on topic text. In empirical comparisons against standard policy gradient methods and RL fine tuning with synthetic preference models, our method shows significant gains in prompt relevance and consistency over a non RL baseline. While it does not yet match the performance of fully human supervised RLHF systems, it highlights an important direction for scaling alignment with minimal human labeling. We provide a detailed analysis, discuss potential limitations, and outline future work for combining cross-attention based signals with smaller amounts of human feedback.</p></details> |  |

Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics.

These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, project page at https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this challenge in science communication, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions. Guided by a carefully balanced combination of word- and sentence-level accessibility rewards, our language model effectively substitutes technical terms with more accessible alternatives, a task which models supervised fine-tuned or guided by conventional readability measures struggle to accomplish. Our best model adjusts the readability level of scholarly abstracts by approximately six U.S. grade levels -- in other words, from a postgraduate to a high school level. This translates to roughly a 90% relative boost over the supervised fine-tuning baseline, all while maintaining factual accuracy and high-quality language. An in-depth analysis of our approach shows that balanced rewards lead to systematic modifications in the base model, likely contributing to smoother optimization and superior performance. We envision this work as a step toward bridging the gap between scholarly research and the general public, particularly younger readers and those without a college degree.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how the model's context length and the complexity of the training dataset influence the training process of R1-like models. Our experiments reveal three key insights: (1) adopting longer context lengths may not necessarily result in better performance; (2) selecting an appropriate context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) appropriately controlling the model's context length and curating training data based on input prompt length can effectively improve RL training efficiency, achieving better performance with shorter thinking length. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework with the progressive context extension strategy, and successfully accelerate the training process of RL models. Experimental results demonstrate that FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview across all five benchmarks while only utilizing 50\% of training steps. Furthermore, all training stages for FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview are completed using a single node with 8 GPUs.</p></details> | Ongoing Work |

Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.08400</p></details> |

To overcome this issue, in this work, we employ an Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (IAI) approach that combines evolutionary computation with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to generate interpretable decision-making policies in the form of decision trees. This IAI solution is embedded within a simulation-based optimization framework specifically designed to handle the inherent uncertainties and stochastic behaviors of modern supply chains. To our knowledge, this marks the first attempt to combine IAI with simulation-based optimization for decision-making in SCM. The methodology is tested on two supply chain optimization problems, one fictional and one from the real world, and its performance is compared against widely used optimization and RL algorithms. The results reveal that the interpretable approach delivers competitive, and sometimes better, performance, challenging the prevailing notion that there must be a trade-off between interpretability and optimization efficiency. Additionally, the developed framework demonstrates strong potential for industrial applications, offering seamless integration with various Python-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 28th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary and bio-inspired Computation (EvoStar 2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we study the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reducing convective heat transfer in the 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC) system under increasing turbulence. We investigate the generalizability of control across varying initial conditions and turbulence levels and introduce a reward shaping technique to accelerate the training. RL agents trained via single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are compared to linear proportional derivative (PD) controllers from classical control theory. The RL agents reduced convection, measured by the Nusselt Number, by up to 33% in moderately turbulent systems and 10% in highly turbulent settings, clearly outperforming PD control in all settings. The agents showed strong generalization performance across different initial conditions and to a significant extent, generalized to higher degrees of turbulence. The reward shaping improved sample efficiency and consistently stabilized the Nusselt Number to higher turbulence levels.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing novel views from limited inputs, their outputs often suffer from visual artifacts and lack 3D consistency, posing challenges for reliable mesh optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enhance sparse-view mesh reconstruction in a principled and reliable manner. To address the instability of diffusion outputs, we propose a Consensus Diffusion Module that filters unreliable generations via interquartile range (IQR) analysis and performs variance-aware image fusion to produce robust pseudo-supervision. Building on this, we design an online reinforcement learning strategy based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to adaptively select the most informative viewpoints for enhancement, guided by diffusion loss. Finally, the fused images are used to jointly supervise a NeRF-based model alongside sparse-view ground truth, ensuring consistency across both geometry and appearance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both geometric quality and rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

Model-based approaches are particularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and generalizability. However, due to inherent model errors, model-based methods often artificially introduce conservatism guided by heuristic uncertainty estimation, which can be unreliable. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel model-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback from value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is learned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned directly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform comprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can learn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing methods. It offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into existing model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model accuracy. As a result, VIPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Driven by the need for random multiple-access (RMA) in massive communication, as well as, next-generation Wi-Fi, medium access control has attracted considerable recent attention. Holding the promise of attaining bandwidth-efficient collision resolution, multiaccess reservation no doubt plays a central role in RMA, e.g., the distributed coordination function (DCF) in IEEE 802.11. In this paper, we are interested in maximizing the bandwidth efficiency of reservation protocols for RMA under quality-of-service constraints. Particularly, we present a tree splitting based reservation scheme, in which the attempting probability is dynamically optimized by partially observable Markov decision process or reinforcement learning (RL). The RL-empowered tree-splitting algorithm guarantees that all these terminals with backlogged packets at the beginning of a contention cycle can be scheduled, thereby providing a first-in-first-out service. More importantly, it substantially reduces the reservation bandwidth determined by the communication complexity of DCF, through judiciously conceived coding and interaction for exchanging information required by distributed ordering. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the CSMA/CA based DCF in IEEE 802.11.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.

To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring reconstruction quality for the ground user, we propose a novel metric to measure delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> |

Although offline RL explicitly avoids environment interaction, prior methods frequently employ extensive, undocumented online evaluation for hyperparameter tuning, complicating method comparisons. Moreover, existing reference implementations differ significantly in boilerplate code, obscuring their core algorithmic contributions. We address these challenges by first introducing a rigorous taxonomy and a transparent evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies online tuning budgets. To resolve opaque algorithmic design, we provide clean, minimalistic, single-file implementations of various model-free and model-based offline RL methods, significantly enhancing clarity and achieving substantial speed-ups. Leveraging these streamlined implementations, we propose Unifloral, a unified algorithm that encapsulates diverse prior approaches within a single, comprehensive hyperparameter space, enabling algorithm development in a shared hyperparameter space. Using Unifloral with our rigorous evaluation protocol, we develop two novel algorithms - TD3-AWR (model-free) and MoBRAC (model-based) - which substantially outperform established baselines.

Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

We first propose CLS-RL for classification, using verifiable rewards to encourage MLLM thinking. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a 'free-lunch' generalization effect (improving performance on unseen datasets after training on one dataset). We then question if this explicit thinking is always necessary for RFT. Challenging convention that explicit thinking is crucial for RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, minimizing thinking via a simple equality accuracy reward. Experiments show No-Thinking-RL surpasses CLS-RL in in-domain and generalization abilities, with significantly less fine-tuning time. This suggests reducing thinking can improve MLLM fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness for certain visual tasks. We hypothesize explicit thinking negatively impacts reward convergence during RFT. To test this, we propose the Think-After-Answerwer method to let models first output the answer and then generate thinking process to alliviate the negative impact of thinking. We further test No-Thinking-RL on diverse tasks (including math, spatial, puzzles) with 2B and 7B models. For 2B models, No-Thinking-RL outperforms thinking-based RFT for all tasks, even on math, with Think-After-Answerwer performing intermediately. For 7B models, performance is comparable on simple visual tasks, but RFT with thinking excels on complex reasoning (math). This implies when dealing with complex math problems, smaller models struggle with generating effective reasoning, hurting performance on complex tasks. Conversely, for simple visual tasks, thinking is not indispensable, and its removal can boost performance and reduce training time. We hope our findings offer insights for better understanding the effect of the thinking process in RFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress.

In particular: it is highly non-stationary; suffers from high degrees of plasticity loss; and requires exploration to prevent premature convergence to local optima and maximize return. In this paper, we consider whether learned optimization can help overcome these problems. Our method, Learned Optimization for Plasticity, Exploration and Non-stationarity (OPEN), meta-learns an update rule whose input features and output structure are informed by previously proposed solutions to these difficulties. We show that our parameterization is flexible enough to enable meta-learning in diverse learning contexts, including the ability to use stochasticity for exploration. Our experiments demonstrate that when meta-trained on single and small sets of environments, OPEN outperforms or equals traditionally used optimizers. Furthermore, OPEN shows strong generalization characteristics across a range of environments and agent architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Metadata for Neurips 2024</p></details> |

One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

To enable broader applications, some works have attempted to transfer these capabilities to multimodal reasoning. However, these efforts have been limited by the limited difficulty of selected tasks and relatively small training scales, making it challenging to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMK12 dataset and MM-EUREKA with 7B and 32B parameters. The former is a high-quality multimodal mathematics reasoning dataset featuring diverse knowledge domains with human-verified answers and solution processes. The latter is a multimodal model employing rule-based reinforcement learning on MMK12, utilizing online filtering and two-stage training strategy to enhance training stability. MM-EUREKA demonstrates remarkable performance gains in multimodal mathematical reasoning, outperforming previous powerful models like InternVL2.5-78B or InternVL2.5-38B-MPO. In particular, MM-EUREKA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models, and trails slightly behind o1 in multidisciplinary reasoning tasks. We open-source our complete pipeline to foster further research in this area. We release all our codes, models, data, etc. at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA</p></details> |  |

We propose the contextualized, task-relevant (CTR) attention network, which generates attention maps from both human and RL agent gameplay in Atari environments. These maps are sparse yet retain the necessary information for the current player's decision making. We compare the CTR-derived attention maps with a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA) model based on eye-tracking data, serving as a point of comparison and discussion. Visual inspection reveals distinct attention patterns: human CTR maps focus on the player and rather nearby opponents, occasionally shifting between stronger focus and broader views - sometimes even attending to empty space ahead. In contrast, agent maps maintain a consistent broad focus on most objects, including distant ones and the player. Quantitative analysis further demonstrates that human CTR maps align more closely with TIOA than agent maps do. Our findings indicate that the CTR attention network can effectively reveal human covert attention patterns from gameplay alone, without the need for additional data like brain activity recordings. This work contributes to understanding human-agent attention differences and enables the development of RL agents augmented with human covert attention.</p></details> |  |

To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</p></details> |  |

Such cultural divergence has become one of the biggest challenges in deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) across diverse regions today. The current emergence of data-driven methods has shown a potential solution to enable culture-compatible driving through learning from data, but what if some underdeveloped regions cannot provide sufficient local data to inform driving culture? This issue is particularly significant for a broader global AV market. Here, we propose a cross-cultural deployment scheme for AVs, called data-light inverse reinforcement learning, designed to re-calibrate culture-specific AVs and assimilate them into other cultures. First, we report the divergence in driving cultures through a comprehensive comparative analysis of naturalistic driving datasets on highways from three countries: Germany, China, and the USA. Then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by testing the expeditious cross-cultural deployment across these three countries, with cumulative testing mileage of over 56084 km. The performance is particularly advantageous when cross-cultural deployment is carried out without affluent local data. Results show that we can reduce the dependence on local data by a margin of 98.67% at best. This study is expected to bring a broader, fairer AV global market, particularly in those regions that lack enough local data to develop culture-compatible AVs.</p></details> |  |

The platform uses a Reinforcement Learning agent to add minimum distortion to input images while still causing misclassification by the target model. The agent uses a novel dual-action method to explore the input image at each step to identify sensitive regions for adding distortions while removing noises that have less impact on the target model. This dual action leads to faster and more efficient convergence of the attack. The platform can also be used to measure the robustness of image classification models against specific distortion types. Also, retraining the model with adversarial samples significantly improved robustness when evaluated on benchmark datasets. The proposed platform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average number of queries required to cause misclassification.

These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Drone-based additive manufacturing promises flexible and autonomous material deposition in large-scale or hazardous environments. However, achieving robust real-time control of a multi-rotor aerial robot under varying payloads and potential disturbances remains challenging. Traditional controllers like PID often require frequent parameter re-tuning, limiting their applicability in dynamic scenarios. We propose a DRL framework that learns adaptable control policies for multi-rotor drones performing waypoint navigation in AM tasks. We compare Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) within a curriculum learning scheme designed to handle increasing complexity. Our experiments show TD3 consistently balances training stability, accuracy, and success, particularly when mass variability is introduced. These findings provide a scalable path toward robust, autonomous drone control in additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

Traditional sensor placement techniques are often constrained by one-off optimisation strategies, which limit their applicability for online applications requiring continuous informative data assimilation. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor placement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment of an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the evolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital twin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and reliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is validated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever plate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement learning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data acquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |

This is due in part to the sequential nature of RL in which actions are chosen because of their likelihood of obtaining future rewards. However, RL agents discard the qualitative features of their training, making it difficult to recover user-understandable information for "why" an action is chosen. We propose a technique Experiential Explanations to generate counterfactual explanations by training influence predictors along with the RL policy. Influence predictors are models that learn how different sources of reward affect the agent in different states, thus restoring information about how the policy reflects the environment. Two human evaluation studies revealed that participants presented with Experiential Explanations were better able to correctly guess what an agent would do than those presented with other standard types of explanation. Participants also found that Experiential Explanations are more understandable, satisfying, complete, useful, and accurate. Qualitative analysis provides information on the factors of Experiential Explanations that are most useful and the desired characteristics that participants seek from the explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>(50 p...</summary><p>(50 pages, 28 figures) Published in the Journal of Neural Computing & Applications (2025) Code is available in: https://github.com/amal994/Experiential-Explanations-RL</p></details> |

Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first open-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised fine-tuning or cold-start. We propose a rule-metric mixed reward mechanism to guide LLMs towards improved translation quality via emergent reasoning. On the WMT 24 English-Chinese benchmark, our MT-R1-Zero-3B-Mix achieves competitive performance, surpassing TowerInstruct-7B-v0.2 by an average of 1.26 points.

However, the computation, data and results are prone to tampering due to the vulnerabilities on the server side. Thus, verifying the integrity of computation is important in the client-server setting. The cryptographic method known as Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is renowned for facilitating private and verifiable computing. ZKP allows the client to validate that the results from the server are computed correctly without violating the privacy of the server's intellectual property. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), in particular, has been widely applied in various applications like blockchain and verifiable machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing zkSNARKs approaches remain highly computationally intensive. For instance, even basic operations like matrix multiplication require an extensive number of constraints, resulting in significant overhead. In addressing this challenge, we introduce \textit{zkVC}, which optimizes the ZKP computation for matrix multiplication, enabling rapid proof generation on the server side and efficient verification on the client side. zkVC integrates optimized ZKP modules, such as Constraint-reduced Polynomial Circuit (CRPC) and Prefix-Sum Query (PSQ), collectively yielding a more than 12-fold increase in proof speed over prior methods.

The ever-evolving digital landscape has gone through many technological transformations that have also affected the way entities are digitally identified. During this digital evolution, identity management has shifted from centralized to decentralized approaches. The last era of this journey is represented by the emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which gives users full control over their data. SSI leverages decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), which have been recently standardized by the World Wide Web Community (W3C). These technologies have the potential to build more secure and decentralized digital identity systems, remarkably contributing to strengthening the security of communications that typically involve many distributed participants. It is worth noting that the scope of DIDs and VCs extends beyond individuals, encompassing a broad range of entities including cloud, edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) resources. However, due to their novelty, existing literature lacks a comprehensive survey on how DIDs and VCs have been employed in different application domains, which go beyond SSI systems. This paper provides readers with a comprehensive overview of such technologies from different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide the background on DIDs and VCs. Then, we analyze available implementations and offer an in-depth review of how these technologies have been employed across different use-case scenarios. Furthermore, we examine recent regulations and initiatives that have been emerging worldwide. Finally, we present some challenges that hinder their adoption in real-world scenarios and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures, and 10 tables</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.</p></details> | 32 pages |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding LLMs in external data, it fails to address the core challenges of trustworthy analytics - especially when processing noisy, inconsistent, or multi-modal data (for example, text, tables, images). We propose DataMosaic, a framework designed to make LLM-powered analytics both explainable and verifiable. By dynamically extracting task-specific structures (for example, tables, graphs, trees) from raw data, DataMosaic provides transparent, step-by-step reasoning traces and enables validation of intermediate results. Built on a multi-agent framework, DataMosaic orchestrates self-adaptive agents that align with downstream task requirements, enhancing consistency, completeness, and privacy. Through this approach, DataMosaic not only tackles the limitations of current LLM-powered analytics systems but also lays the groundwork for a new paradigm of grounded, accurate, and explainable multi-modal data analytics.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AgentGym, the largest procedurally-curated executable gym environment for training real-world SWE-agents, consisting of more than 8.7K tasks. AgentGym is powered by two main contributions: 1) SYNGEN: a synthetic data curation recipe that enables scalable curation of executable environments using test-generation and back-translation directly from commits, thereby reducing reliance on human-written issues or unit tests. We show that this enables more scalable training leading to pass@1 performance of 34.4% on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark with our 32B model. 2) Hybrid Test-time Scaling: we provide an in-depth analysis of two test-time scaling axes; execution-based and execution-free verifiers, demonstrating that they exhibit complementary strengths and limitations. Test-based verifiers suffer from low distinguishability, while execution-free verifiers are biased and often rely on stylistic features. Surprisingly, we find that while each approach individually saturates around 42-43%, significantly higher gains can be obtained by leveraging their complementary strengths. Overall, our approach achieves 51% on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE-agents and for the first time showing competitive performance with proprietary models such as o1, o1-preview and sonnet-3.5-v2 (with tools). We will open-source our environments, models, and agent trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://r2e-gym.github.io/</p></details> |

Search-based approaches have demonstrated scalability and effectiveness in automatically finding high-performance programs for specific hardware. However, the search process is often inefficient, taking hours or even days to discover optimal programs due to the exploration mechanisms guided by an accurate but slow-learned cost model. Meanwhile, the learned cost model trained on one platform cannot seamlessly adapt online to another, which we call cross-platform online unawareness. In this work, we propose Pruner and MoA-Pruner. Pruner is a "Draft-then-Verify" exploration mechanism that accelerates the schedule search process. Instead of applying the complex learned cost model to all explored candidates, Pruner drafts small-scale potential candidates by introducing a naive Symbol-based Analyzer (draft model), then identifies the best candidates by the learned cost model. MoA-Pruner introduces a Momentum online Adaptation strategy to address the cross-platform online unawareness. We incorporate Pruner into the TVM and conduct extensive experiments on three GPU-based platforms. Results show considerable speedup in schedule search time. In online tuning scenarios, Pruner and MoA-Pruner achieve an average speedup of $2.6 \times$ and $4.82 \times$ compared to Ansor. In offline tuning scenarios, Pruner achieves an average speedup of $4.75 \times$ and $4.05\times$ compared to TenSet and TLP, respectively. Furthermore, Pruner achieves an average speedup of $4.08 \times$ compared to MetaSchedule on TensorCore.</p></details> |  |

The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating (verifying) and computing (synthesizing/realizing) which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the Nash equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since subgame perfect equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of Nash equilibria and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</p></details> | <details><summary>LMCS ...</summary><p>LMCS format for submission</p></details> |

To address this limitation, this paper introduces VECOGEN, a novel tool that combines large language models with formal verification to automate the generation of formally verified C programs. VECOGEN takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language, a natural language specification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a verified program. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VECOGEN generates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are sure the program is correct. We evaluate VECOGEN on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems, VECOGEN solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining large language models with formal verification to automate program generation.</p></details> |  |

It can be used for determining the user's path within a prior map, which is a huge demand for applications in pedestrian navigation, collaborative mapping, augmented reality, and emergency rescue. However, existing LiDAR-based global localization methods suffer from insufficient robustness, especially in complex large-scale outdoor scenes with insufficient features and incomplete coverage of the prior map. To address such challenges, we propose LiDAR-based reliable global localization (Reliable-loc) exploiting the verifiable cues in the sequential LiDAR data. First, we propose a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) based on spatially verifiable cues, utilizing the rich information embedded in local features to adjust the particles' weights hence avoiding the particles converging to erroneous regions. Second, we propose a localization status monitoring mechanism guided by the sequential pose uncertainties and adaptively switching the localization mode using the temporal verifiable cues to avoid the crash of the localization system. To validate the proposed Reliable-loc, comprehensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale heterogeneous point cloud dataset consisting of high-precision vehicle-mounted mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds and helmet-mounted WLS point clouds, which cover various street scenes with a length of over 30 km. The experimental results indicate that Reliable-loc exhibits high robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in large-scale, complex street scenes, with a position accuracy of 2.91 m, yaw accuracy of 3.74 degrees, and achieves real-time performance.

Because synthesis and verification are closely intertwined, the SemGuS framework raises the problem of how to verify programs in a solver and domain-agnostic way. We prove that the problem of verifying whether a program is a valid solution to a SemGuS problem can be reduced to proving validity of a query in the `CLP calculus, a fixed-point logic that generalizes Constrained Horn Clauses and co-Constrained Horn Clauses. Our encoding into `CLP allows us to further classify the SemGuS verification problems into ones that are reducible to validity of (i) first-order-logic formulas, (ii) Constrained Horn Clauses, (iii) co-Constrained Horn Clauses, and (iv) `CLP queries. Furthermore, our encoding shines light on some limitations of the SemGuS framework, such as its inability to model nondeterminism and reactive synthesis. We thus propose a modification to SemGuS that makes it more expressive, and for which verifying solutions is exactly equivalent to proving validity of a query in the `CLP calculus. Our implementation of SemGuS verifiers based on the above encoding can verify instances that were not even encodable in previous work. Furthermore, we use our SemGuS verifiers within an enumeration-based SemGuS solver to correctly synthesize solutions to SemGuS problems that no previous SemGuS synthesizer could solve.</p></details> |  |

It is attractive because it can prove the absence of errors with the same certainty as mathematicians proving theorems. However, while most security experts recognize the value of formal verification, the views of non-technical users on this topic are unknown. To address this issue, we designed and implemented two experiments to understand how formal verification impacts users. Our approach started with a formative study involving 15 participants, followed by the main quantitative study with 200 individuals. We focus on the application domain of password managers since it has been documented that the lack of trust in password managers might lead to lower adoption. Moreover, recent efforts have focused on formally verifying (parts of) password managers. We conclude that formal verification is seen as desirable by users and identify three actional recommendations to improve formal verification communication efforts.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, code verification has recently found great success as a critical component in improving reasoning capability of LLMs via reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a an approach which can transform existing coding benchmarks into scoring and ranking datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic verifiers. We also propose multiple metrics to measure different aspects of the synthetic verifiers with the proposed benchmarks. By employing the proposed approach, we release four new benchmarks (HE-R, HE-R+, MBPP-R, and MBPP-R+), and analyzed synthetic verification methods with standard, reasoning-based, and reward-based LLMs. Our experiments show that reasoning can significantly improve test case generation and that scaling the number of test cases enhances the verification accuracy.</p></details> |  |

A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification.

However, its extension to broader, less structured domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness and scalability of RLVR across diverse real-world domains including medicine, chemistry, psychology, economics, and education, where structured reference answers are typically unavailable. We reveal that binary verification judgments on broad-domain tasks exhibit high consistency across various LLMs provided expert-written reference answers exist. Motivated by this finding, we utilize a generative scoring technique that yields soft, model-based reward signals to overcome limitations posed by binary verifications, especially in free-form, unstructured answer scenarios. We further demonstrate the feasibility of training cross-domain generative reward models using relatively small (7B) LLMs without the need for extensive domain-specific annotation. Through comprehensive experiments, our RLVR framework establishes clear performance gains, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art open-source aligned models such as Qwen2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across domains in free-form settings. Our approach notably enhances the robustness, flexibility, and scalability of RLVR, representing a substantial step towards practical reinforcement learning applications in complex, noisy-label scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The Game of Life is Turing complete, and people have been building increasingly sophisticated constructions within GOL, such as 8-bit displays, Turing machines, and even an implementation of GOL itself. In this paper, we report on a project to build an implementation of GOL within GOL, via logic circuits, fully formally verified within the HOL4 theorem prover. This required a combination of interactive tactic proving, symbolic simulation, and semi-automated forward proof to assemble the components into an infinite circuit which can calculate the next step of the simulation while respecting signal propagation delays. The result is a verified "GOL in GOL compiler" which takes an initial GOL state and returns a mega-cell version of it that can be passed to off-the-shelf GOL simulators, such as Golly. We believe these techniques are also applicable to other cellular automata, as well as for hardware verification which takes into account both the physical configuration of components and wire delays.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ITP 2025</p></details> |

To address this problem, we propose Language Instruction grounding for Motion Planning (LIMP), an approach that enables robots to verifiably follow complex, open-ended instructions in real-world environments without prebuilt semantic maps. LIMP constructs a symbolic instruction representation that reveals the robot's alignment with an instructor's intended motives and affords the synthesis of correct-by-construction robot behaviors. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of LIMP on 150 instructions across five real-world environments, demonstrating its versatility and ease of deployment in diverse, unstructured domains. LIMP performs comparably to state-of-the-art baselines on standard open-vocabulary tasks and additionally achieves a 79\% success rate on complex spatiotemporal instructions, significantly outperforming baselines that only reach 38\%.

Verifying safety requires extending control theoretic analysis methods to these systems. Although existing techniques can efficiently handle linear neural feedback systems, relatively few scalable methods address the nonlinear case. We propose a novel algorithm for forward reachability analysis of nonlinear neural feedback systems. The approach leverages the structure of the nonlinear transition functions of the systems to compute tight polyhedral enclosures (i.e., abstractions). These enclosures, combined with the neural controller, are then encoded as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Optimizing this MILP yields a sound over-approximation of the forward-reachable set. We evaluate our algorithm on representative benchmarks and demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement over the current state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Although verified approaches like SISA, using data slicing and checkpointing, achieve efficient unlearning for single models by reverting to intermediate states, these methods struggle in teacher-student knowledge distillation settings. Unlearning in the teacher typically forces costly, complete student retraining due to pervasive information propagation during distillation. Our primary contribution is PURGE (Partitioned Unlearning with Retraining Guarantee for Ensembles), a novel framework integrating verified unlearning with distillation. We introduce constituent mapping and an incremental multi-teacher strategy that partitions the distillation process, confines each teacher constituent's impact to distinct student data subsets, and crucially maintains data isolation. The PURGE framework substantially reduces retraining overhead, requiring only partial student updates when teacher-side unlearning occurs. We provide both theoretical analysis, quantifying significant speed-ups in the unlearning process, and empirical validation on multiple datasets, demonstrating that PURGE achieves these efficiency gains while maintaining student accuracy comparable to standard baselines.</p></details> |  |

In the European Union, the EUDI Digital Identity wallet is about to become a concrete implementation of this paradigm. However, a debate is still ongoing, partially reflecting some aspects that are not yet consolidated in the scientific state of the art. Among these, an effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving implementation of verifiable credential revocation remains a subject of discussion. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose the basis of a novel method that customizes the use of anonymous hierarchical identity-based encryption to restrict the Verifier access to the temporal authorizations granted by the Holder. This way, the Issuer cannot track the Holder's credential presentations, and the Verifier cannot check revocation information beyond what is permitted by the Holder.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Process Supervision from a Theoretical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10581v2)** | 2025-03-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.10581v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models have evolved, it has become crucial to distinguish between process supervision and outcome supervision -- two key reinforcement learning approaches to complex reasoning tasks. While process supervision offers intuitive advantages for long-term credit assignment, the precise relationship between these paradigms has remained an open question. Conventional wisdom suggests that outcome supervision is fundamentally more challenging due to the trajectory-level coverage problem, leading to significant investment in collecting fine-grained process supervision data. In this paper, we take steps towards resolving this debate. Our main theorem shows that, under standard data coverage assumptions, reinforcement learning through outcome supervision is no more statistically difficult than through process supervision, up to polynomial factors in horizon. At the core of this result lies the novel Change of Trajectory Measure Lemma -- a technical tool that bridges return-based trajectory measure and step-level distribution shift. Furthermore, for settings with access to a verifier or a rollout capability, we prove that any policy's advantage function can serve as an optimal process reward model, providing a direct connection between outcome and process supervision. These findings suggest that the empirically observed performance gap -- if any -- between outcome and process supervision likely stems from algorithmic limitations rather than inherent statistical difficulties, potentially transforming how we approach data collection and algorithm design for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.</p></details> |  |

With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., "In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.</p></details> | 33 pages, EMNLP24 |

Traditional approaches to verifiable FHE require expensive cryptographic proofs, which incur an overhead of up to seven orders of magnitude on top of FHE, making them impractical. With Argos, we show that trusted hardware can be securely used to provide verifiability for FHE computations, with minimal overhead relative to the baseline FHE computation. An important contribution of Argos is showing that the major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural side channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the CPU and the memory hierarchy. This is made possible by focusing on building a platform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality. All secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate coprocessor (e.g., a TPM)-inaccessible to any software-based attacker. Relying on a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is why (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. As a second contribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can be adapted to only incur a fixed cost. Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity processors from 2008 onward. Our prototype implementation introduces 3% overhead for FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols. In particular, we show that Argos can be used for real-world applications of FHE, such as private information retrieval (PIR) and private set intersection (PSI), where providing verifiability is imperative. By demonstrating how to combine cryptography with trusted hardware, Argos paves the way for widespread deployment of FHE-based protocols beyond the semi-honest setting, without the overhead of cryptographic proofs.</p></details> |  |

To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid sets a new state-of-the-art task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 9.5%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves an impressively low latency of 0.7 seconds per step, making it the first mobile agent capable of delivering near-real-time, effective decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 iterations, refine figs</p></details> |

Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 4 Figures.

Although recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks primarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual reasoning capabilities. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a benchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. VERIFY compels models to reason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases. Each problem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first to provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes. Additionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity beyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model reasoning patterns. Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers significant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic approach to both perception and reasoning.

We show in this paper that GRPO with verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback Leibler ($\mathsf{KL}$) regularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data sampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\pi_{n}$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first and second order statistics of the old policy ($\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\pi_0$. Iterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\pi_{n}$ for which we can quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of success of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of a function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_0$ and the regularization parameter $\beta$ of the $\mathsf{KL}$ regularizer. We show that the fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_0$, thereby demonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the policy.</p></details> |  |

Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at Correctness 2024</p></details> |

Generally, a large-scale (e.g., continental or global) continuous map of static WTD can be simulated using either physically-based (PB) or machine learning-based (ML) models. We construct three fine-resolution (500 m) ML simulations of WTD, using the XGBoost algorithm and more than 20 million real and proxy observations of WTD, across the United States and Canada. The three ML models were constrained using known physical relations between WTD's drivers and WTD and were trained by sequentially adding real and proxy observations of WTD. Through an extensive (pixel-by-pixel) evaluation across the study region and within ten major ecoregions of North America, we demonstrate that our models (corr=0.6-0.75) can more accurately predict unseen real and proxy observations of WTD compared to two available PB simulations of WTD (corr=0.21-0.40). However, we still argue that currently-available large-scale simulations of static WTD could be uncertain within data-scarce regions such as steep mountainous regions. We reason that biased observational data mainly collected from low-elevation floodplains and the over-flexibility of available models can negatively affect the verifiability of large-scale simulations of WTD. Ultimately, we thoroughly discuss future directions that may help hydrogeologists decide how to improve machine learning-based WTD estimations. In particular, we advocate for the use of proxy satellite data, the incorporation of physical laws, the implementation of better model verification standards, the development of novel globally-available emergent indices, and the collection of more reliable observations.</p></details> |  |

Today, many graph search services have been outsourced to a third-party server to facilitate storage and computational support. Nevertheless, the outsourcing paradigm may invade the privacy of graphs. PeGraph is the latest scheme achieving encrypted search over social graphs to address the privacy leakage, which maintains two data structures XSet and TSet motivated by the OXT technology to support encrypted conjunctive search. However, PeGraph still exhibits limitations inherent to the underlying OXT. It does not provide transparent search capabilities, suffers from expensive computation and result pattern leakages, and it fails to support search over dynamic encrypted graph database and results verification. In this paper, we propose SecGraph to address the first two limitations, which adopts a novel system architecture that leverages an SGX-enabled cloud server to provide users with secure and transparent search services since the secret key protection and computational overhead have been offloaded to the cloud server. Besides, we design an LDCF-encoded XSet based on the Logarithmic Dynamic Cuckoo Filter to facilitate efficient plaintext computation in trusted memory, effectively mitigating the risks of result pattern leakage and performance degradation due to exceeding the limited trusted memory capacity. Finally, we design a new dynamic version of TSet named Twin-TSet to enable conjunctive search over dynamic encrypted graph database. In order to support verifiable search, we further propose VSecGraph, which utilizes a procedure-oriented verification method to verify all data structures loaded into the trusted memory, thus bypassing the computational overhead associated with the client's local verification.</p></details> |  |

The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Models</p></details> |

Soda is a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the compilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed high-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and programming language. Given these capabilities, Soda can implement multi-agent systems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream software ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art tools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to Soda and the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple demonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with Soda. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect to real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, various frameworks for modeling database transactions and reasoning about their isolation guarantees have been developed. What is missing however is a mathematically rigorous and systematic framework with tool support for formally verifying a wide range of such guarantees for all possible system behaviors. We present the first such framework, VerIso, developed within the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. To showcase its use in verification, we model the strict two-phase locking concurrency control protocol and verify that it provides strict serializability isolation guarantee. Moreover, we show how VerIso helps identify isolation bugs during protocol design. We derive new counterexamples for the TAPIR protocol from failed attempts to prove its claimed strict serializability. In particular, we show that it violates a much weaker isolation level, namely, atomic visibility.</p></details> |  |

In particular, our algorithms achieve a runtime of $\mathcal{O}\left(dk \cdot \left(nM\right)^{\lceil k / 2 \rceil}\right)$ while ensuring high-probability correctness. Our contributions include: A unified framework for verifying Kruskal rank across different algebraic settings; Rigorous runtime and high-probability guarantees that nearly match known lower bounds; Practical implications for identifiability in tensor decompositions and deep learning, particularly for the estimation of noise transition matrices.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiteChain: A Lightweight Blockchain for Verifiable and Scalable Federated Learning in Massive Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04140v1)** | 2025-03-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.04140v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging blockchain in Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new paradigm for secure collaborative learning on Massive Edge Networks (MENs). As the scale of MENs increases, it becomes more difficult to implement and manage a blockchain among edge devices due to complex communication topologies, heterogeneous computation capabilities, and limited storage capacities. Moreover, the lack of a standard metric for blockchain security becomes a significant issue. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight blockchain for verifiable and scalable FL, namely LiteChain, to provide efficient and secure services in MENs. Specifically, we develop a distributed clustering algorithm to reorganize MENs into a two-level structure to improve communication and computing efficiency under security requirements. Moreover, we introduce a Comprehensive Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CBFT) consensus mechanism and a secure update mechanism to ensure the security of model transactions through LiteChain. Our experiments based on Hyperledger Fabric demonstrate that LiteChain presents the lowest end-to-end latency and on-chain storage overheads across various network scales, outperforming the other two benchmarks. In addition, LiteChain exhibits a high level of robustness against replay and data poisoning attacks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF), which, in conjunction with the controller, ensures that the closed-loop system is incrementally ISS. To address the unknown dynamics of the system, we parameterize the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF as neural networks and learn them by utilizing the sampled data from the state space of the unknown system. To formally verify the obtained $\delta$-ISS-CLF, we develop a validity condition and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed approach is proved using multiple case studies - the first one is a scalar system with a non-affine non-polynomial structure, the second example is a one-link manipulator system, the third system is a nonlinear Moore-Grietzer model of the jet engine and the final one is a rotating rigid spacecraft model.</p></details> |  |

Despite a history of targeting by adversaries, relatively little academic work has been done to increase visibility into how voter registration systems keep voters' data secure, accurate, and up to date. Enhancing transparency and verifiability could help election officials and the public detect and mitigate risks to this essential component of electoral processes worldwide. This work introduces cryptographic verifiability for voter registration systems. Based on consultation with diverse expert stakeholders that support elections systems, we precisely define the requirements for cryptographic verifiability in voter registration and systematize the practical challenges that must be overcome for near-term deployment. We then introduce VRLog, the first system to bring strong verifiability to voter registration. VRLog enables election officials to provide a transparent log that (1) allows voters to verify that their registration data has not been tampered with and (2) allows the public to monitor update patterns and database consistency. We also introduce VRLog$^x$, an enhancement to VRLog that offers cryptographic privacy to voter deduplication between jurisdictions - a common maintenance task currently performed in plaintext or using trusted third parties. Our designs rely on standard, efficient cryptographic primitives, and are backward compatible with existing voter registration systems. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of VRLog and benchmarks to demonstrate that the system is practical - capable of running on low-cost commodity hardware and scaling to support databases the size of the largest U.S. state voter registration systems.</p></details> |  |

Decentralized approaches, where participants exchange computation results instead of raw private data, mitigate these risks but introduce challenges related to trust and verifiability. A critical issue arises: How can one ensure the integrity and validity of computation results shared by other participants? Existing survey articles predominantly address security and privacy concerns in decentralized machine learning, whereas this survey uniquely highlights the emerging issue of verifiability. Recognizing the critical role of zero-knowledge proofs in ensuring verifiability, we present a comprehensive review of Zero-Knowledge Proof-based Verifiable Machine Learning (ZKP-VML). To clarify the research problem, we present a definition of ZKP-VML consisting of four algorithms, along with several corresponding key security properties. Besides, we provide an overview of the current research landscape by systematically organizing the research timeline and categorizing existing schemes based on their security properties. Furthermore, through an in-depth analysis of each existing scheme, we summarize their technical contributions and optimization strategies, aiming to uncover common design principles underlying ZKP-VML schemes. Building on the reviews and analysis presented, we identify current research challenges and suggest future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive survey to date on verifiable decentralized machine learning and ZKP-VML.</p></details> |  |

While many unlearning methods have been proposed, none of them enable users to audit the procedure. Furthermore, recent work shows a user is unable to verify whether their data was unlearnt from an inspection of the model parameter alone. Rather than reasoning about parameters, we propose to view verifiable unlearning as a security problem. To this end, we present the first cryptographic definition of verifiable unlearning to formally capture the guarantees of an unlearning system. In this framework, the server first computes a proof that the model was trained on a dataset D. Given a user's data point d requested to be deleted, the server updates the model using an unlearning algorithm. It then provides a proof of the correct execution of unlearning and that d is not part of D', where D' is the new training dataset (i.e., d has been removed). Our framework is generally applicable to different unlearning techniques that we abstract as admissible functions. We instantiate a protocol in the framework, based on cryptographic assumptions, using SNARKs and hash chains. Finally, we implement the protocol for three different unlearning techniques and validate its feasibility for linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE SaTML2025</p></details> |
